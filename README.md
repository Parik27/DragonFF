## Manually

In older versions of Blender or to get the newest changes (that may be unstable), use the following instructions to install Blender from GitHub.

1. [Download](https://github.com/Parik27/DragonFF/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the addon zip file from the latest master branch
2. Import the downloaded .zip file by selecting it from *(User) Preferences/Addons/Install from File*
3. Set the addon "GTA DragonFF" to enabled
4. Import dff from Import tab or an IPL/IFP from the panel in *Scene Settings*

* [X] - TXD - `txd.py`
